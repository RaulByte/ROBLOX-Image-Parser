# Misconceptions
This is NOT designed to bypass Roblox's Decal Moderation when uploading Decals. Rather a prototype project to further gain a sense of understanding in methods of bypassing certain restrictions. This is by no means practical for exploiting.

# Pre-Requisites
Python 3.7.2 (maybe downgradable)
