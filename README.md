# About
So basically, this is a python/flask based program that can fetch images from the web (or stored in my archive folder) and then loads it into a pixel array
that is then jsonified. Thus allows Roblox to use HTTPService and fetch the Jsonified data.


# Pre-Requisites
Python 3.7.2 (maybe downgradable)
